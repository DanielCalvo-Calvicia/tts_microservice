# TTS Microservice Technical README

This README is a technical knowledge-transfer document for the current `tts_microservice` codebase. It is based on repository inspection of the Python source, configuration files, tests, and checked-in runtime artifacts.

Where behavior is not explicit in code, it is marked as **Inferred** or **Needs verification**.

## Project Overview

This project implements a small Text-to-Speech HTTP microservice. It exposes a FastAPI server that accepts text, synthesizes speech with a configurable outbound adapter, and returns audio either as newline-delimited JSON streaming events or as a JSON payload containing base64 audio data.

The code is organized around a ports-and-adapters, or hexagonal, architecture:

- Inbound adapter: FastAPI HTTP API in `infrastructure/inbound/http/fastapi_adapter.py`.
- Application service: orchestration layer in `application/services/service.py`.
- Outbound adapters:
  - Local `pyttsx3` TTS engine in `infrastructure/outbound/tts/pyttsx3_adapter.py`.
  - OpenAI-compatible audio speech API in `infrastructure/outbound/tts/openai_tts_adapter.py`.
- Composition root: dependency wiring and server startup in `composition_root/`.

Main responsibilities:

- Start a FastAPI application through Uvicorn.
- Load runtime configuration from `.env`.
- Accept standard NDJSON text stream events through HTTP streaming endpoints.
- Convert text `partial` events into async text streams.
- Synthesize audio with either local `pyttsx3` subprocesses or the OpenAI speech API.
- Stream generated audio chunks as explicit NDJSON events.
- Support a decoupled two-step streaming flow where one request starts synthesis and another request drains the generated audio queue.
- Provide basic health and TTS availability checks.

Core business logic:

- Text stream input is sent as NDJSON standard stream events.
- Each text `partial` payload is synthesized independently.
- The default local adapter writes a temporary `.wav` file through `pyttsx3`.
- The service reads local temporary WAV files with Python's `wave` module in 1024-frame chunks.
- The OpenAI adapter streams bytes from `/audio/speech` in 8192-byte chunks.
- Chunks are placed on an `asyncio.Queue` or yielded through an async iterator.
- The HTTP adapter wraps chunks in `partial` events and emits `completed` for each logical output.
- Internal `None` sentinels end queue-backed audio streams, but clients must rely on `completed`, not connection close or sentinel markers.

Main workflows and lifecycle:

1. `main.py` calls `asyncio.run(setup())`.
2. `setup()` loads `.env`, reads `SERVICE_HOST` and `SERVICE_PORT`, builds the dependency container, and starts a Uvicorn server.
3. `BuildContainer()` creates a `TTSDependency` graph.
4. `generate_tts_dependency()` creates `PyTTSx3Adapter`, `TTSService`, a FastAPI app, and `FastApiAdapter`.
5. FastAPI routes call adapter methods, which map inbound DTOs to service DTOs.
6. `TTSService` maps service DTOs to outbound DTOs and delegates to `PyTTSx3Adapter`.
7. The outbound adapter invokes the configured TTS backend and returns audio bytes to the HTTP adapter.
8. The HTTP adapter encodes streamed bytes as NDJSON events with monotonic sequence numbers.
9. On shutdown, Uvicorn exits, FastAPI lifespan calls `stop_autoload()`, and `setup()` calls `_cleanup()`.

## Streaming Contract

`POST /process/stream`, `POST /process/stream/set`, and `GET /process/stream/get` use `application/x-ndjson` for stream contracts. Each line is one complete JSON object:

```json
{"type":"stream_started","sequence":1,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:00Z","payload":{}}
{"type":"partial","sequence":2,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:01Z","payload":{"bytes_base64":"UklGRg=="}}
{"type":"completed","sequence":3,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:02Z","payload":{"reason":"completed","output_bytes_base64":"UklGRg=="}}
```

Required event fields are `type`, `sequence`, `timestamp`, and `payload`. `sequence` starts at `1` and increments by `1` for every event in the stream. Timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 strings. Text input uses `partial` payloads shaped as `{"text":"..."}` and a final `completed` payload shaped as `{"reason":"completed","output":"..."}`. Binary audio output is base64 encoded in `bytes_base64` for `partial` events and `output_bytes_base64` for `completed`.

Raw text stream request bodies are not accepted. Clients must send standard NDJSON stream events to `POST /process/stream` and `POST /process/stream/set`.

Clients should process `completed` immediately as the end of the current logical output. The HTTP connection may remain open afterward, optionally emitting `heartbeat` events when `keep_open_after_completed=true`.

### Internal Modules and Responsibilities

`main.py`

- Minimal process entry point.
- Runs `composition_root.setup.setup()` inside `asyncio.run`.
- Catches `KeyboardInterrupt` and prints an exit message.

`composition_root/setup/setup.py`

- Loads `.env` using `python-dotenv`.
- Reads `SERVICE_HOST` and `SERVICE_PORT`.
- Builds the dependency graph.
- Creates and runs `uvicorn.Server`.
- Configures Uvicorn `timeout_keep_alive=60`.
- Calls `_cleanup(container)` in a `finally` block.

`composition_root/containers/container.py`

- Defines immutable `Container`.
- Calls `generate_tts_dependency()`.

`composition_root/dependencies/tts_dependency.py`

- Reads outbound TTS config:
  - `TTS_ADAPTER`, default `pyttsx3`
  - `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`, default `140`
  - `TTS_VOICE_NAME`, default `Zira`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`, required when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL`, default `gpt-4o-mini-tts`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE`, default `alloy`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_RESPONSE_FORMAT`, default `wav`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_INSTRUCTIONS`, optional
  - `OPENAI_TTS_SPEED`, optional float
  - `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, default `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- Creates:
  - `PyTTSx3Adapter` when `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`
  - `OpenAITTSAdapter` when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`
  - `TTSService`
  - `FastAPI`
  - `FastApiAdapter`
- Configures FastAPI metadata and built-in docs:
  - `/docs`
  - `/redoc`
  - `/openapi.json`
- Defines FastAPI lifespan that calls `adapter_inbound.start_autoload()` on startup and `adapter_inbound.stop_autoload()` on shutdown. Both adapter methods are currently no-ops.

`application/ports/`

- Defines abstract interfaces for the inbound adapter, outbound adapter, and application service.
- These interfaces are useful extension points for replacing HTTP or TTS implementations.

`application/dtos/`

- Defines dataclass DTOs for each architectural boundary:
  - `adapter_inbound_dtos.py`
  - `services_dtos.py`
  - `adapter_outbound_dtos.py`
- The DTO files intentionally duplicate shapes per layer, then mapper modules translate between them.

`application/dtos/mapper/`

- Contains explicit mapping functions between inbound, service, and outbound DTOs.
- Current mappings are field copies with no validation or enrichment.

`application/services/service.py`

- Implements `TTSService`.
- Does not perform synthesis itself.
- Orchestrates by mapping service DTOs to outbound DTOs, calling the outbound port, then mapping outbound responses back to service responses.

`infrastructure/inbound/http/fastapi_adapter.py`

- Implements `AdapterInboundPort`.
- Registers all FastAPI routes.
- Parses HTTP request bodies and query parameters.
- Converts raw request data into inbound DTOs.
- Returns `JSONResponse` or `StreamingResponse`.

`infrastructure/outbound/tts/pyttsx3_adapter.py`

- Implements `AdapterOutboundPort`.
- Uses `pyttsx3` through dynamically generated Python scripts executed in subprocesses.
- Writes synthesis output to temporary WAV files.
- Reads WAV frames into async queues and async iterators.
- Stores one shared queue for the decoupled `set_stream` / `get_stream` flow.

`infrastructure/outbound/tts/openai_tts_adapter.py`

- Implements `AdapterOutboundPort`.
- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to call an OpenAI-compatible `/audio/speech` endpoint.
- Streams response bytes in 8192-byte chunks.
- Supports the same streaming, decoupled streaming, batch, and availability port methods as the local adapter.
- Stores one shared queue for the decoupled `set_stream` / `get_stream` flow.

## Runtime Flow

### Startup Sequence

1. `main.py` imports `setup` and calls `asyncio.run(setup())`.
2. `setup()` resolves the runtime environment with `resolve_environment()`.
3. `get_runtime_env_file_path()` selects the matching env file from `.vscode/launch.json` or falls back to `.env`.
4. `SERVICE_HOST` is read, defaulting to `127.0.0.1`.
5. `SERVICE_PORT` is read, defaulting to `8002`.
6. `BuildContainer(name="TTS Microservice")` builds dependencies.
7. `generate_tts_dependency()` reads `TTS_ADAPTER`, local TTS settings, and OpenAI TTS settings.
8. `PyTTSx3Adapter` or `OpenAITTSAdapter` is created from `TTS_ADAPTER`.
9. `TTSService` is created with the outbound adapter.
10. FastAPI app is created with docs enabled.
11. `FastApiAdapter` is created and registers routes on the FastAPI app.
12. Uvicorn server is created and `server.serve()` blocks until shutdown.

### Initialization Process

`TTSService.init()` runs during FastAPI lifespan startup and initializes the selected outbound adapter. For `pyttsx3`, native engine initialization remains lazy inside subprocesses. For OpenAI, adapter initialization validates configuration, including the required API key and response format.

- `/available` checks engine availability.
- `/process/stream` synthesizes each input text `partial` event.
- `/process/stream/set` starts background synthesis.
- `/process/batch` attempts batch synthesis.

### Service Registration

`FastApiAdapter.register_routes()` defines all routes directly with decorators inside the method. There is no `APIRouter`; all endpoints are registered directly on the FastAPI app instance.

### Request Lifecycle

Generic lifecycle:

```text
HTTP request
  -> FastAPI route handler
  -> inbound DTO
  -> inbound-to-service mapper
  -> TTSService method
  -> service-to-outbound mapper
  -> PyTTSx3Adapter method
  -> outbound-to-service mapper
  -> service-to-inbound mapper
  -> JSONResponse or StreamingResponse
```

Streaming lifecycle:

- The HTTP adapter reads the full request body with `await request.body()`.
- It decodes the body as UTF-8.
- It parses and validates standard NDJSON text stream events.
- It converts `partial.payload.text` values into an async text generator.
- The outbound adapter creates an async audio stream and a background generation task.
- Each text `partial` payload is synthesized independently by the selected backend.
- Audio chunks are encoded as `partial` NDJSON events in the HTTP response.
- A `completed` event marks the logical output complete even if the connection remains open.

Decoupled stream lifecycle:

- `POST /process/stream/set` parses text stream events and calls the selected outbound adapter's `set_stream()`.
- The adapter cancels any previous background generation task.
- It replaces the shared `_audio_queue`.
- It starts `_generate_decoupled_audio()` in an `asyncio.create_task`.
- `GET /process/stream/get` returns an adapter-specific async iterator that drains the current shared queue.

### Shutdown Behavior

Shutdown handling exists but is minimal:

- `KeyboardInterrupt` is caught in `main.py`.
- `setup()` always calls `_cleanup(container)` after `server.serve()` finishes.
- `_cleanup()` currently only prints `"Performing graceful shutdown cleanup..."`.
- FastAPI lifespan calls `adapter_inbound.stop_autoload()`, but that method is a no-op.
- **Needs verification:** active `AsyncAudioStream` generation tasks created per streaming request are not centrally tracked for shutdown.
- **Needs verification:** active outbound adapter `_generator_task` values for decoupled streaming are not explicitly cancelled during shutdown.

### `GET /health`

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: Basic service health response.
- Authentication: none.
- Request format: no body.
- Response format: JSON envelope.
- Internal handler: `health_check()` in `FastApiAdapter.register_routes()`.
- Dependencies triggered: none beyond FastAPI.
- Side effects: none.
- Required environment variables: none beyond server bind config.
- Failure behavior: no explicit error handling in handler; ordinary FastAPI exception handling applies if unexpected failure occurs.
- Timeout/retry behavior: no app-level timeout or retry.

Example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8002/health
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "action": "health_check",
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": "Service is healthy",
  "timestamp": 1710000000.0,
  "data": null
}
```

### `GET /available`

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: Check whether the local TTS engine can initialize.
- Authentication: none.
- Request format: no body.
- Response format: JSON envelope with `data.is_available`.
- Internal handler: `handle_check_availability()`.
- Dependencies triggered:
  - `TTSService.is_available()`
  - `PyTTSx3Adapter.is_available()`
  - subprocess using `sys.executable -c "import pyttsx3; engine = pyttsx3.init(); del engine"`
- Side effects:
  - Spawns a subprocess.
  - Initializes the OS TTS engine in that subprocess.
- Required environment variables: none directly.
- Failure behavior:
  - If subprocess returns non-zero, response still has HTTP 200 with `is_available: false`.
  - If handler raises, returns HTTP 500 JSON envelope.
- Timeout/retry behavior:
  - No explicit timeout.
  - No retry.

Example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8002/available
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "action": "check_availability",
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,

- Side effects:
  - Creates one temporary `.wav` file per text line.
  - Spawns one subprocess per text line.
  - Deletes each temporary WAV file after streaming.
  - Logs generated subprocess script, PID, and stdout to process stdout.
- Required environment variables:
  - `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`, optional, default `140`
  - `TTS_VOICE_NAME`, optional, default `Zira`
- Failure behavior:
  - If input is not valid standard NDJSON stream events, returns HTTP 400 JSON envelope.
  - If route setup or initial processing raises, returns HTTP 500 JSON envelope.
  - If errors occur after streaming begins, the stream emits an `error` event with `code`, `message`, and `recoverable`.
  - `_run_tts_subprocess()` returns an exception object instead of raising it to the caller. Current callers do not inspect the return value, so a failed subprocess can lead to a later `wave.open()` failure or empty/missing output.
- Timeout/retry behavior:
  - No explicit synthesis timeout.
  - No retry.
  - Uvicorn keep-alive timeout is 60 seconds.
  - `await asyncio.sleep(0.001)` is used between chunks to yield event-loop control.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8002/process/stream?sample_rate=22050&channels=1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" \
  --data-binary $'{"type":"stream_started","sequence":1,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:00Z","payload":{}}\n{"type":"partial","sequence":2,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:01Z","payload":{"text":"Hello from line one."}}\n{"type":"partial","sequence":3,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:02Z","payload":{"text":"Hello from line two."}}\n{"type":"completed","sequence":4,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:03Z","payload":{"reason":"completed","output":"Hello from line one.Hello from line two."}}\n'
```

Expected response:

- HTTP 200
- Body is streamed NDJSON events. Example:

```json
{"type":"stream_started","sequence":1,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:00Z","payload":{}}
{"type":"partial","sequence":2,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:01Z","payload":{"bytes_base64":"UklGRg=="}}
{"type":"completed","sequence":3,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:02Z","payload":{"reason":"completed","output_bytes_base64":"UklGRg=="}}
```

### `POST /process/stream/set`

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: Submit text for background synthesis into one shared decoupled audio queue.
- Authentication: none.
- Request format:
  - Body: `application/x-ndjson`.
  - The same standard text stream event shape required by `POST /process/stream`.
  - Query parameters:
    - `sample_rate`, default `22050`
    - `channels`, default `1`
- Response format: JSON envelope with HTTP 202.
- Internal handler: `handle_set_stream()`.
- Dependencies triggered:
  - `TTSService.set_stream()`
  - `PyTTSx3Adapter.set_stream()`
  - `_generate_decoupled_audio()` background task
  - `_run_tts_subprocess()`
- Side effects:
  - Cancels any previous decoupled synthesis task.

  - Creates and deletes temporary WAV files.
- Required environment variables:
  - `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`, optional, default `140`
  - `TTS_VOICE_NAME`, optional, default `Zira`
- Failure behavior:
  - Handler returns HTTP 400 JSON envelope if input is not valid standard NDJSON stream events.
  - Handler returns HTTP 500 JSON envelope if setup fails.
  - Background task catches `asyncio.CancelledError`.
  - Background task always places `None` sentinel on the queue in `finally`.
- Timeout/retry behavior:
  - No explicit timeout.
  - No retry.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8002/process/stream/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" \
  --data-binary $'{"type":"stream_started","sequence":1,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:00Z","payload":{}}\n{"type":"partial","sequence":2,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:01Z","payload":{"text":"First sentence."}}\n{"type":"partial","sequence":3,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:02Z","payload":{"text":"Second sentence."}}\n{"type":"completed","sequence":4,"timestamp":"2026-05-24T12:00:03Z","payload":{"reason":"completed","output":"First sentence.Second sentence."}}\n'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "action": "set_stream",
  "status": "accepted",
  "status_code": 202,
  "message": "Stream accepted. Background synthesis started.",
  "timestamp": 1710000000.0,
  "data": null
}
```

### `GET /process/stream/get`

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: Retrieve audio events from the current decoupled audio queue.
- Authentication: none.
- Request format:
  - No body.
  - Query parameters:
    - `keep_open_after_completed`, default `false`
    - `heartbeat_interval_seconds`, default `15.0`
- Response format:
  - `StreamingResponse`
  - `Content-Type`: `application/x-ndjson`
  - Body: one JSON event per line with `stream_started`, zero or more `partial` events, and one `completed` event per logical output.
  - Headers:
    - `Cache-Control: no-cache`
    - `Connection: keep-alive`
    - `X-Action: get_stream`
    - `X-Status: success`
    - `X-Message: Decoupled stream retrieved successfully`
    - `X-Timestamp: <unix timestamp>`
- Internal handler: `handle_get_stream()`.
- Dependencies triggered:
  - `TTSService.get_stream()`
  - `PyTTSx3Adapter.get_stream()`
  - `DecoupledAudioStream`
- Side effects:
  - Drains `_audio_queue`.
  - Multiple clients would compete for chunks from the same queue. **Inferred:** this is a single-consumer or competing-consumer model, not broadcast.
- Required environment variables: none directly.
- Failure behavior:
  - If no stream has been set, the handler returns an iterator over the current empty queue and may wait indefinitely for chunks. **Needs verification.**
  - If handler setup fails, returns HTTP 500 JSON envelope.
  - Logical completion is signaled by a `completed` event when the internal `None` sentinel is read.
- Timeout/retry behavior:
  - No explicit timeout.
  - No retry.
  - Uvicorn keep-alive timeout is 60 seconds.

Example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8002/process/stream/get
```

Expected response:

- HTTP 200
- Streaming NDJSON events from the shared queue.

### `POST /process/batch`

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: Synthesize a complete text string and return base64 audio data in JSON.
- Authentication: none.
- Request format:
  - `text` is declared as a plain function parameter, not as a Pydantic body model.
  - In FastAPI, this means `text` is expected as a query parameter unless otherwise annotated.
  - Query parameters:
    - `text`, default `""`
    - `sample_rate`, default `22050`
    - `channels`, default `1`
- Response format: JSON envelope with `data.audio_data_base64`, `sample_rate`, and `channels`.
- Internal handler: `handle_process_batch()`.
- Dependencies triggered:
  - `TTSService.process_batch()`
  - Selected outbound adapter:
    - `PyTTSx3Adapter.process_batch()`, `_run_tts_subprocess()`, and a temporary WAV file when `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`
    - `OpenAITTSAdapter.process_batch()` and `/audio/speech` when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`
- Side effects:
  - `pyttsx3`: creates and deletes a temporary WAV file.
  - OpenAI: performs an outbound HTTP request.
- Required environment variables:
  - `TTS_ADAPTER`, optional, default `pyttsx3`
  - `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`, optional, default `140`
  - `TTS_VOICE_NAME`, optional, default `Zira`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`, required when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`
- Failure behavior:
  - If `text` is empty, route raises `HTTPException(400)`, but the broad `except Exception` catches it and returns HTTP 500 instead of HTTP 400.
  - The included `tests/simple.py` sends JSON `{"text": ...}`, which does not match the current FastAPI signature and will not populate `text`.
- Timeout/retry behavior:
  - No explicit timeout.
  - No retry.

Example matching current FastAPI signature:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8002/process/batch?text=Hello%20world&sample_rate=22050&channels=1"
```

Example intended response shape:

```json
{
  "action": "process_batch",
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": "Text synthesized successfully",
  "timestamp": 1710000000.0,
  "data": {
    "audio_data_base64": "...",
    "sample_rate": 22050,
    "channels": 1
  }
}
```

### Built-In FastAPI Documentation Interfaces

`GET /docs`, `GET /redoc`, and `GET /openapi.json` are enabled in `composition_root/dependencies/tts_dependency.py`.

- Port: `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`
- Protocol: HTTP
- Authentication: none
- Purpose: inspect API schema and interact with endpoints.
- Side effects: none.
- Failure behavior: FastAPI default behavior.

### CLI Interfaces

`python main.py`

- Starts the service.
- Reads `.env`.
- Binds Uvicorn to `SERVICE_HOST:SERVICE_PORT`.

`python tests/simple.py`

- Manual integration test.
- Assumes the server is already running at `http://127.0.0.1:8002`.
- Tests `/health`, `/available`, `/process/batch`, and `/process/stream`.
- **Needs verification:** the batch part currently sends JSON, but the endpoint expects `text` as a query parameter.

`python tests/test_decoupled_stream.py`

- Manual integration test.
- Assumes the server is already running.
- Uses `TTS_TEST_BASE_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:8002`.
- Posts text to `/process/stream/set`.
- Streams bytes from `/process/stream/get`.

## Outbound Integrations

### `pyttsx3`

- Purpose: local text-to-speech synthesis.
- How it is used:
  - Dynamically generated Python code imports `pyttsx3`, initializes the engine, sets speech rate, selects a voice, calls `engine.save_to_file(text, file_path)`, and runs `engine.runAndWait()`.
  - Code is executed through `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(sys.executable, "-c", script)`.
- Authentication: none.
- Retry behavior: none.
- Failure modes:
  - `pyttsx3.init()` fails.
  - Required native speech backend is missing or misconfigured.
  - Voice preference does not match an installed voice.
  - Subprocess exits non-zero.
  - Generated temp file is missing, empty, or invalid.
- Required configs:
  - `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`
  - `TTS_VOICE_NAME`

### OpenAI-Compatible Speech API

- Purpose: remote text-to-speech synthesis through an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
- How it is used:
  - `OpenAITTSAdapter.iter_speech_chunks()` sends `POST {OPENAI_BASE_URL}/audio/speech`.
  - Requests include `model`, `voice`, `input`, and `response_format`.
  - Optional `instructions` and `speed` fields are included when configured.
  - Response bytes are streamed with `httpx` in 8192-byte chunks.
- Authentication: bearer token from `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Retry behavior: none.
- Timeout behavior:
  - Speech requests use an `httpx.Timeout` of 120 seconds.
  - Availability checks use an `httpx.Timeout` of 10 seconds.
- Failure modes:
  - Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`.
  - Invalid `OPENAI_TTS_RESPONSE_FORMAT`.
  - Network failure or timeout.
  - API returns HTTP 4xx or 5xx.
- Required configs:
  - `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Optional configs:
  - `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_RESPONSE_FORMAT`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_INSTRUCTIONS`
  - `OPENAI_TTS_SPEED`
  - `OPENAI_BASE_URL`

### OS Native TTS Backend

`pyttsx3` delegates to native speech engines depending on platform.

- Windows: likely SAPI5. The existing `README_STREAMING.md` explicitly discusses SAPI5 and COM isolation.
- Linux: typically `espeak` or related system packages. **Needs verification:** no OS package installation script exists in this repository.
- macOS: typically NSSpeechSynthesizer. **Needs verification:** not tested in this repository.

Authentication: none.

Failure modes:

- Missing native speech engine.
- No matching voice.
- COM/threading issues on Windows if not isolated. This code mitigates that by using subprocesses.

### Temporary File System

- Purpose: bridge `pyttsx3.save_to_file()` output into Python audio streaming.
- How it is used:
  - `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".wav", delete=False)` creates a file path.
  - `pyttsx3` writes to that path in a subprocess.
  - Main process opens the file with `wave.open()`.
  - File is deleted in `finally`.
- Authentication: OS file permissions.
- Retry behavior: none.
- Failure modes:
  - No temp directory permissions.
  - Disk full.
  - File deletion failure. Deletion errors are swallowed.

### Network Dependencies

No outbound HTTP APIs, databases, SaaS APIs, cloud services, message brokers, or hardware network devices were found.

## Data Model

There is no database schema and no persistent domain model. The service uses dataclass DTOs to describe request and response shapes across layers.

Key entities:

| Entity | Location | Fields | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `InitOutboundAdapterDto` | `application/dtos/adapter_outbound_dtos.py` | `speech_rate`, `voice_name_preference` | Configures `PyTTSx3Adapter`. |
| `InitInboundAdapterDto` | `application/dtos/adapter_inbound_dtos.py` | none | Placeholder for inbound adapter config. |
| `ProcessStreamRequestDto` | all DTO layers | `text_stream`, `sample_rate`, `channels` | Streaming synthesis input. |
| `ProcessStreamResponseDto` | all DTO layers | `audio_stream` | Streaming synthesis output. |
| `SetStreamRequestDto` | all DTO layers | `text_stream`, `sample_rate`, `channels` | Decoupled background synthesis input. |
| `GetStreamRequestDto` | all DTO layers | none | Request to retrieve decoupled stream. |
| `GetStreamResponseDto` | all DTO layers | `audio_stream` | Decoupled stream output. |
| `ProcessBatchRequestDto` | all DTO layers | `text`, `sample_rate`, `channels` | Batch synthesis input. |
| `ProcessBatchResponseDto` | all DTO layers | `audio_data` | Batch synthesis output. |
| `TTSAvailabilityRequestDto` | all DTO layers | none | Availability check request. |
| `TTSAvailabilityResponseDto` | all DTO layers | `is_available` | Availability check result. |

Relationships:

- Inbound DTOs map to service DTOs.
- Service DTOs map to outbound DTOs.
- Outbound responses map back to service responses.
- Service responses map back to inbound responses.

Caching strategy:

- No explicit cache exists.
- The decoupled stream queue temporarily stores audio chunks in memory until consumed.

Database structure:

- No database code, migrations, connection strings, ORM, or SQL was found.

## Configuration

Configuration sources:

- VS Code launch configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` is the primary execution-environment definition.
- Each launch profile declares `APP_ENV`, `VSCODE_LAUNCH_PROFILE`, and an `envFile`.
- Process environment variables are used at runtime. When launched from VS Code, these include values from the selected profile's `env` and `envFile`.
- `.env`, `.env.staging`, and `.env.production` hold profile-specific runtime defaults for host, port, speech rate, and voice name.

Runtime environment resolution:

- Supported values are `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
- Environment precedence is process `VSCODE_ENV`, process `APP_ENV`, then `VSCODE_LAUNCH_PROFILE` mapped through `.vscode/launch.json`.
- `env` values in a launch profile override values from that profile's `envFile`.
- Env-file selection uses the selected `VSCODE_LAUNCH_PROFILE` first, then the first launch profile matching the resolved environment, then `.env` as the development fallback.
- `debug`, `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` are accepted aliases for `development`, `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
- Missing or invalid environment values fall back to `development`, the safe default with full local diagnostics.

Launch profile environment mapping:

| Launch profile | `envFile` | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Python: Debug (development env)` | `.env` | `development` |
| `Python: Run (staging env)` | `.env.staging` | `staging` |
| `Python: Run (production env)` | `.env.production` | `production` |

Logging behavior:

| Environment | Enabled levels |
| --- | --- |
| `development` | `trace`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `critical` |
| `staging` | `warn`, `error`, `critical` |
| `production` | `critical` |

Every application log line includes timestamp, environment, level, and module scope. Uvicorn/FastAPI server logs are always shown at `info` level or higher, including access logs, in every environment.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VSCODE_ENV` | No | `development` | Highest-precedence runtime environment override. | `staging` |
| `APP_ENV` | No | `development` | Launch-profile runtime environment. | `development` |
| `VSCODE_LAUNCH_PROFILE` | No | None | Optional launch profile name used to map `.vscode/launch.json` to an environment. | `Python: Run (production env)` |
| `SERVICE_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Host/interface passed to Uvicorn. | `0.0.0.0` |
| `SERVICE_PORT` | No | `8002` | TCP port passed to Uvicorn. | `8002` |
| `TTS_ADAPTER` | No | `pyttsx3` | Selects outbound backend. Valid values are `pyttsx3` and `openai`. | `openai` |
| `TTS_SPEECH_RATE` | No | `140` | Speech rate passed to `engine.setProperty('rate', ...)`. Must parse as integer. | `140` |
| `TTS_VOICE_NAME` | No | `Zira` | Preferred voice name substring used during voice selection. | `Zira` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai` | None | Bearer token used by `OpenAITTSAdapter`. | `sk-...` |
| `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | Speech model sent to `/audio/speech`. | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` |
| `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE` | No | `alloy` | Voice sent to `/audio/speech`. | `alloy` |
| `OPENAI_TTS_RESPONSE_FORMAT` | No | `wav` | Audio response format. Must be `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, or `pcm`. | `wav` |
| `OPENAI_TTS_INSTRUCTIONS` | No | None | Optional style instructions passed to the speech API. | `Speak clearly.` |
| `OPENAI_TTS_SPEED` | No | None | Optional speech speed parsed as float. | `1.0` |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible API base URL. | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `TTS_TEST_BASE_URL` | No | `http://127.0.0.1:8002` | Used only by `tests/test_decoupled_stream.py`. | `http://127.0.0.1:8002` |

Config files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.env` | Development runtime config for host, port, speech rate, and voice name. |
| `.env.staging` | Staging runtime config for host, port, speech rate, and voice name. |
| `.env.production` | Production runtime config for host, port, speech rate, and voice name. |
| `infrastructure/config.py` | Runtime environment resolver that reads process env and `.vscode/launch.json`. |
| `infrastructure/logger.py` | Centralized Logger utility and environment-specific logging setup. |
| `requirements.windows.txt` | Python dependency list for Windows. |
| `requirements.linux.txt` | Python dependency list for Linux. Same contents as Windows at inspection time. |
| `.vscode/launch.json` | Development, staging, and production launch profiles. |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | VS Code interpreter settings. |

Secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required only when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`.
- The default `pyttsx3` backend requires no authentication credentials or API keys.

Important config caveats:

- `TTS_SPEECH_RATE` is cast with `int(...)`; non-integer values will fail container construction.
- `OPENAI_TTS_SPEED` is cast with `float(...)` when set; non-float values will fail container construction.
- `TTS_ADAPTER` must be either `pyttsx3` or `openai`.
- `OPENAI_TTS_RESPONSE_FORMAT` is validated during OpenAI adapter initialization and must be one of `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, or `pcm`.
- To add a new launch profile, copy an existing profile in `.vscode/launch.json`, set `APP_ENV` or `VSCODE_ENV` to one of the supported environments, set `VSCODE_LAUNCH_PROFILE` to the profile name, and point `envFile` at the matching env file.
- To add a new environment beyond `development`, `staging`, or `production`, update `SUPPORTED_ENVIRONMENTS` in `infrastructure/config.py`, add the logging threshold in `infrastructure/logger.py`, and create/update the relevant VS Code launch profile and env file.

## Build & Deployment

### Run Locally

Windows using the checked-in virtual environment:

```powershell
.\windows\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

Generic Python environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.windows.txt
python main.py
```

Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.linux.txt
python main.py
```

**Needs verification:** Linux may require native `espeak` packages for `pyttsx3` to work. No apt/yum/apk package instructions are included in this repository.

### Build

No package build configuration was found:

- No `pyproject.toml`
- No `setup.py` package metadata
- No Dockerfile
- No Makefile
- No lock file

The project is run directly from source.

### Docker Usage

No Dockerfile or Compose file was found.

If containerizing this service later, preserve these requirements:

- Install Python dependencies from requirements file.
- If using `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`, install the OS TTS backend required by `pyttsx3`.
- If using `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`, ensure subprocess execution is allowed.
- If using `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`, ensure a writable temp directory exists.
- If using `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`, provide `OPENAI_API_KEY` and outbound network access to `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.
- Expose `SERVICE_PORT`, default `8002`.

### CI/CD Behavior

No CI/CD configuration was found:

- No `.github/workflows`
- No GitLab CI config
- No Azure Pipelines config
- No test runner config

### Production Deployment Assumptions

**Inferred:**

- The service is intended to run as a long-lived HTTP process.
- Deployment must provide either local/native TTS capability or an OpenAI-compatible speech API.
- When using `pyttsx3`, the service should run on a host where `pyttsx3` can initialize a compatible speech backend.
- When using OpenAI, deployment must provide network access to the configured API base URL.
- `SERVICE_HOST=0.0.0.0` is likely needed for container or remote access.

## Dependencies

Both `requirements.windows.txt` and `requirements.linux.txt` contain:

| Dependency | Constraint | Why used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fastapi` | `>=0.110.0` | HTTP API framework and OpenAPI docs. |
| `uvicorn` | `>=0.29.0` | ASGI server. |
| `python-dotenv` | `>=1.0.1` | Loading `.env` at startup. |
| `pydantic` | `>=2.6.4` | FastAPI dependency. Current DTOs use dataclasses, not Pydantic models. |
| `httpx` | `>=0.27.0` | Manual integration test client and OpenAI-compatible TTS HTTP client. |
| `pyttsx3` | `>=2.90` | Local TTS engine wrapper. |

Critical version constraints:

- No upper bounds are pinned.
- No lock file is present.
- **Needs verification:** compatibility with Python 3.14. The checked-in `windows` virtual environment appears to use Python 3.14 based on paths such as `.cpython-314.pyc` and `pip3.14.exe`.

## State & Persistence

Databases:

- None.

File storage:

- Temporary WAV files are created for each synthesis operation and deleted after use.
- Generated `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` directories are present.
- A full `windows` virtual environment is checked into the repository.

Cache:

- No cache layer.

Session management:

- No user sessions.
- No authentication sessions.

Persistent runtime state:

- `PyTTSx3Adapter` holds:
  - `_audio_queue`: shared queue for decoupled stream flow.
  - `_generator_task`: current background synthesis task for decoupled stream flow.
- This state is process-local and lost on restart.
- The decoupled queue is shared globally across all clients of the service instance.

## Failure & Recovery

Known failure points:

- `.env` values may be invalid, especially `SERVICE_PORT` and `TTS_SPEECH_RATE`, which are cast to integers.
- `pyttsx3` may fail to initialize.
- OS TTS backend may be unavailable.
- Voice selection may not find `TTS_VOICE_NAME`.
- Generated subprocess may fail.
- Temporary WAV file may not be created or may be invalid.
- `wave.open()` may fail on invalid/empty output.
- Long-running synthesis has no timeout.
- Decoupled `GET /process/stream/get` can wait on an empty queue if no stream is active. **Needs verification.**
- Multiple decoupled consumers compete for one shared queue. **Inferred.**
- Mid-stream errors are not converted into structured JSON because streaming responses may already be in progress.

Retry logic:

- None.

Error handling strategy:

- HTTP route handlers catch broad `Exception` and return JSON envelopes with HTTP 500.
- `is_available()` catches exceptions and returns `is_available=False`.
- Background generator tasks catch `asyncio.CancelledError`.
- Temporary file deletion ignores `OSError`.
- `_run_tts_subprocess()` logs and re-raises exceptions.

Recovery mechanisms:

- Restarting the service resets process-local queues and background tasks.
- Calling `POST /process/stream/set` cancels the previous decoupled synthesis task and replaces the queue.
- Failed temp file deletion is ignored, so manual cleanup of OS temp directories may be needed if many failures occur.

## Security

Authentication:

- None.

Authorization:

- None.

Secrets handling:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used when `TTS_ADAPTER=openai`.
- `.env` is present in the repository and should contain only non-secret local config unless repository policy changes.

Sensitive flows:

- Text submitted to synthesis endpoints is passed into generated Python code through `repr(...)`, which prevents straightforward code injection through the text itself.
- The generated subprocess script is printed to stdout and includes the text being synthesized. This can leak user-provided text into logs.
- Temporary WAV files contain synthesized speech and exist briefly on disk.

Exposed attack surface:

- Unauthenticated HTTP endpoints can trigger CPU, process, disk, native TTS, or outbound API work depending on the selected adapter.
- With `TTS_ADAPTER=pyttsx3`, each input line can spawn a subprocess.
- Request bodies have no explicit size limit.
- Number of lines has no explicit limit.
- No rate limiting.
- No concurrency limit.
- No local `pyttsx3` synthesis timeout.
- FastAPI docs are publicly exposed on the bind interface.

Recommended hardening for production:

- Add authentication or restrict network access.
- Add request size limits.
- Add line count and text length limits.
- Add subprocess and outbound request timeouts appropriate to the selected backend.
- Add concurrency control around synthesis.
- Remove or reduce subprocess script logging.
- Consider disabling `/docs` and `/redoc` in production.
- Avoid checking virtual environments into source control.

## Tests

The repository contains both script-style integration tests and unittest-based contract tests. There is no dedicated test runner config, but the unittest files can be collected by pytest.

`tests/simple.py`

- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- Hard-codes `BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8002"`.
- Requires the server to already be running.
- Tests:
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /available`
  - `POST /process/batch`
  - `POST /process/stream`
- **Known mismatch:** sends JSON to `/process/batch`, but the endpoint currently expects `text` as a query parameter.

`tests/test_decoupled_stream.py`

- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60.0)`.
- Reads `TTS_TEST_BASE_URL`, defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:8002`.
- Tests:
  - `POST /process/stream/set`
  - `GET /process/stream/get`
- Verifies at least one chunk and non-zero bytes.

`tests/test_stream_contract.py`

- Uses `unittest`, `httpx.ASGITransport`, and a fake `ServicePort`.
- Does not require a live server or a real TTS backend.
- Verifies NDJSON event shape, monotonic sequence numbers, text stream input validation, decoupled stream completion, heartbeat behavior, and structured stream error events.

There is no automated test configuration, no assertions around DTO mapping, and no unit tests for real outbound adapter integrations.

## Derived Project Transfer Notes

Reusable parts:

- The ports-and-adapters layering is reusable.
- DTO mapping modules provide clear boundaries for replacing adapters.
- `TTSService` is mostly transport-agnostic and can remain stable.
- `FastApiAdapter` route structure can be reused for another TTS engine.
- `AdapterOutboundPort` is the key abstraction for swapping between `pyttsx3`, OpenAI-compatible TTS, another engine, or a mock engine.

Tightly coupled parts:

- `PyTTSx3Adapter` is tightly coupled to local subprocess execution, temp WAV files, and the behavior of `pyttsx3`.
- `OpenAITTSAdapter` is tightly coupled to OpenAI-compatible `/audio/speech` and `/models/{model}` endpoints.
- `README_STREAMING.md` and comments assume Windows SAPI5/COM behavior, though requirements include a Linux file too.
- `.vscode` settings are tightly coupled to the checked-in `windows` virtual environment.
- The decoupled streaming design is tightly coupled to a single shared in-memory queue.

Assumptions found in code:

- Text input is UTF-8.
- Text lines are independent synthesis units.
- WAV frame chunks are sent to clients as base64 fields inside NDJSON events, not as raw HTTP audio bytes.
- `sample_rate` and `channels` are accepted at API boundaries but not applied to `pyttsx3` output. They are currently metadata/control placeholders.
- A preferred voice can be selected by checking whether `TTS_VOICE_NAME` is a substring of `voice.name` or whether `'en'` is in `voice.id`.
- The current Python executable has all dependencies needed for subprocess synthesis.

What must be preserved for compatibility:

- Default bind config: `127.0.0.1:8002`.
- NDJSON stream-event input for `/process/stream` and `/process/stream/set`.
- Text `partial` event chunking, where each `partial.payload.text` value is an independent synthesis unit.
- Response envelope fields for JSON endpoints:
  - `action`
  - `status`
  - `status_code`
  - `message`
  - `timestamp`
  - `data`
- Streaming endpoints returning `application/x-ndjson` events with `stream_started`, `partial`, `completed`, optional `heartbeat`, and `error`.
- `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` if clients rely on interactive docs.
- Decoupled flow contract:
  - set with `POST /process/stream/set`
  - retrieve with `GET /process/stream/get`

Recommended extension points:

- Replace `PyTTSx3Adapter` behind `AdapterOutboundPort` for alternative TTS providers.
- Add fields to `InitInboundAdapterDto` for HTTP-specific config.
- Add validation inside FastAPI handlers or DTO constructors.
- Add a Pydantic request model for batch synthesis if JSON body support is desired.
- Add a dedicated stream/session ID model if multiple concurrent decoupled streams are needed.
- Add a queue manager abstraction if decoupled streaming should support multiple clients.

Safe refactoring boundaries:

- DTO mapper functions can be consolidated, but preserve boundary semantics if derived projects depend on explicit layer separation.
- `TTSService` can remain thin; business rules should be added here if they must be independent of HTTP and TTS engines.
- FastAPI route parsing can change independently from outbound synthesis if DTO contracts remain stable.
- Outbound synthesis can be rewritten if `AdapterOutboundPort` behavior remains stable.

Hidden coupling or implicit behavior:

- The decoupled queue is a singleton per service process.
- `GET /process/stream/get` depends on prior `POST /process/stream/set` but does not validate that a stream exists.
- `pyttsx3` subprocess scripts use `sys.executable`, so the parent interpreter environment determines child dependencies.
- `sample_rate` and `channels` flow through DTOs but do not affect synthesis output.
- Broad exception handling converts some client errors into HTTP 500.

If rebuilding this project from scratch, what matters most:

1. Preserve the inbound HTTP contracts that clients use.
2. Preserve the explicit streaming event contract so clients never rely on connection close for logical completion.
3. Keep TTS engine execution isolated from the event loop.
4. Add explicit limits and timeouts around synthesis.
5. Keep batch synthesis returning accumulated audio bytes.
6. Decide whether decoupled streaming is single global queue, per-client session, or broadcast.
7. Treat native TTS setup or OpenAI API access as deployment dependencies.
8. Preserve the adapter boundary if future projects may swap TTS providers.

## Unknowns / Technical Debt

Ambiguous behavior:

- Whether the base64 event payloads should continue to contain raw PCM frames or move to full standalone audio containers.
- Whether Linux/macOS support has been tested.
- Whether `.env.production` is expected to exist.
- Whether `sample_rate` and `channels` are intended future controls or should affect actual output.

Missing documentation:

- No production deployment guide.
- No Docker instructions.
- No native OS TTS dependency installation instructions.
- No CI/CD documentation.
- No API schema examples beyond generated FastAPI docs.
- No concurrency, performance, or sizing guidance.

Risk areas:

- Unauthenticated synthesis endpoints can be abused for resource exhaustion.
- One subprocess per text line can be expensive.
- No request limits or timeouts.
- Broad exception handlers hide specific client errors.
- Logging generated subprocess scripts can leak submitted text.
- Checked-in virtual environment creates large repository noise and platform coupling.
- `__pycache__` artifacts are checked in.

Concrete code issues found:

- `FastApiAdapter.handle_process_batch()` catches `HTTPException(400)` and converts it to HTTP 500.
- `tests/simple.py` sends JSON to `/process/batch`, but the current endpoint expects query parameters.
- Inbound DTO files contain mojibake-style comment separators, likely caused by encoding mismatch in box-drawing comments.

Needs verification:

- Real audio output format validity for common clients.
- Behavior of `GET /process/stream/get` before a stream is set.
- Behavior with multiple concurrent streaming clients.
- Behavior with multiple concurrent decoupled clients.
- Behavior when a client disconnects mid-stream.
- Cleanup of active background tasks on application shutdown.
- Native TTS setup requirements per OS.
